Business Problem:
If a new bank wants to invest in Panamá and open a local branch to serve customers and businesses one of the first decisions they would have to make is where. If the branch is opened in a remote location then very few people will find it convenient to bank with us. And if we just randomly choose dense areas then we may be ignoring a lot of context and therefore there is a very high probability that we will fail to choose the best possible location. Therefore it is important to paint an exact landscape of the business and banking world of Panamá so we can make the optimal decision.

The business problem is therefore finding an efficient way to choose the location of a new branch in Panamá and also to inform ourselves about the general banking landscape so that making these kinds of decisions in the future is much easier.

Data:
We will be working with two geolocation datasets. The first will be a map of all bank branches in Panamá. This will be the main object of our project as the idea will be to cluster banks instead of clustering neighbourhoods. This is because Panamá already has a dense banking sector and we want our decision to be influenced by where other banks have placed their branches. This dataset will include the name of the branch and the coordinates.

The second dataset will be a map of all the other businesses in Panamá. This will allow us to cluster banks by the kinds of businesses they have around them. This dataset will have the coordinates and category of the business. We will not be using the category data that Foursquare gives us but instead we will take that and transform that down to just 10 general variables. For example, we will merge "Coffee Shop" and "Café" into a single variable. This is so at the end of our project the results are easier to interpret and we can actually assign a business sense to all of the clusters we define. This task would be much harder if we did a model with 200 variables, specially when most of the Foursquare categories are very niche.
